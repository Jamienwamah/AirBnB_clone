# The console

This repository contains the first tasks of the AirBnB clone project for [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/software/).
During this first part of the project we had to::
- Put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances.
- Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel
- Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

## Usage

The console (console.py) works like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit  create  destroy  show  all  update

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

But also in non-interactive mode:
```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit  create  destroy  show  all  update
$
```
